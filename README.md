# iOS 6 Icons

Welcome to my iOS 6 Icon collection! A resource for reference and setup makers!

These icons are all in original resolution and .png. All the icons have no changes to the original. No weird-looking recreations. There are also icons already cropped and ready to use for your convenience.

There’s also first party Redditor-made icons for apps that didn’t exist then, like Fitness. Please give credit to [u/Ape2002huh](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ape2002huh/) for creating the Colgate, Apple Support, Apple Music for Artists, Clips, Apple Vision Pro, Magnifier, and Freeform icons if you use them in your pack.

As well, there are 3rd-party icons like Crunchyroll and ALDI (good luck finding them on the internet).

# How?

I used iFile to grab the icons straight from my CoolBooted iPad 4 and iPod touch 5. I did each one manually, so it took forever.

# Why?

![My collection vs Modern6SE](My collection vs Modern6SE.jpg)I'm sick and tired of seeing people use the wrong icons in their setups. They use fake resources like Modern6SE, but most of the icons are wrong! Just look at the image comparing mine with Modern6SE. That's why I created this collection. So people can use the right icons. I hope this helps anyone making an iOS 6 setup.
