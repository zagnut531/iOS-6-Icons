# Where did I get these? 

My jailbroken iPad 4th generation. I bought this magical thing for $22 on eBay in May. It even included the box (no accessories though)! What a steal! 64GB Black so I had plenty of space to dualboot iOS 6. It is my favorite thing I've purchased this year. It is stupid fast on iOS 6, I just love it so much!
