# Where did I get these? 

My jailbroken iPod touch 5th generation. I've had this thing since 2015, and it has been my friend all that time. I did everything with it: take pictures, play games, and watch YouTube. I didn't realize how slow it was on iOS 9 until February when I discovered legacy jailbreaking. I learned how to dualboot iOS 6 on it so I can relive my childhood once again. It's Slate (my favorite color) and 32GB. I hear stories of other peoples' Slate devices chipping and wearing off, but suprisingly, mine is spotless! I used it quite heavily, but I kept it in a case which might explain it. This iPod will always be a part of me.
